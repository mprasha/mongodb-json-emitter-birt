BIRT (Business Intelligence Reporting Tools) is an open source Eclipse-based set of reporting and data visualization tools and technologies used to build rich information applications, in particular, web applications based on Java and J2EE.

The JSON and MongoDB plugin for BIRT is an Eclipse based plugin which enables to emit data from BIRT directly into specified mongoDB database/collection. It also supports exporting output as JSON records which can further be used (for bulk loading to mongodb, etc..).

Though these emitter are non-GUI emitter and work entirely differently than one file output approach, the GUI component has also been enabled to felicitate easy testing or in better ways easy evaluation.

Note: Export from GUI feature could be removed in future releases.
Please Refer the documentation for further details.
